# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Menu Recommendation** project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.0.36] - 2026-01-08
### Added
- **UI UX Improvements**: 
    - **Category Counts**: Displays the number of restaurants for each category toggle (e.g., "Korean (5)").
    - **Sort Buttons**: Replaced text links with touch-friendly segmented buttons for better usability.

## [v0.0.35] - 2026-01-08
### Fixed
- **Category Mismatch**: Unified 'CHINESE_ASIAN' logic to 'ASIAN' to resolve ID mismatch that caused empty filter results.
- **GitHub Actions**: Configured CI/CD pipeline for automated Firebase deployment on push.

## [v0.0.34] - 2026-01-08
### Fixed
- **Distance Calculation**: Enforced distance calculation before filtering to ensure distance is always displayed on cards.

## [v0.0.33] - 2026-01-08
### Added
- **Distance Display**: Added real-time distance calculation (e.g., "350m", "1.2km") next to the restaurant name in the list view.
- **Enhanced Category Filters**: 
    - **JAPANESE**: Includes sushi, ramen, and general Japanese dining.
    - **CHINESE_ASIAN**: Consolidated Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, and other Asian cuisines into a single robust category.
    - **WESTERN**: Expanded to include Pizza, Burger, Steak, Italian, and Mexican.
- **Unified Sidebar UI**: Completed the transition to a responsive sidebar that handles both the restaurant list and detail views, preventing map obstruction on mobile.

### Fixed
- **Distance Calculation**: Fixed a bug where distance was only calculated during sorting, resulting in missing values in the UI.
- **Filter Logic**: Resolved an issue where strict type matching caused many valid restaurants to be categorized as 'ETC'.

## [v0.0.30 - v0.0.32] - 2026-01-08
### Added
- **Search UX**: Changed "Search Nearby" button to "**Search in this Map**" (현 지도에서 검색) to clarify it searches the current viewport, not just the user's location.
- **Responsive Design**: optimized modal heights (60vh on mobile) to ensure map visibility.

### Fixed
- **Deployment Issues**: addresed file update failures during the CI/CD pipeline.
- **UI Glitches**: Fixed overlap issues with floating action buttons and the header.

## [v0.0.20 - v0.0.29] - 2026-01-07
### Added
